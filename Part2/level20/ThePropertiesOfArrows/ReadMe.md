# The Properties of Arrows

Vin Fletcher once again has run to catch up to you for help with his arrows.

"My apologies, Programmer! This will be the last time I bother you. My cousin, Flynn Vetcher, is the only other arrow maker in the area. He doesn't care for his craft and makes wildly dangerous and overpriced arrows. But people keep buying them because they think my `GetLength()` methods are harder to work with than his public `_length` fields. I don't want to give up the protections we just gave these arrows, but I remembered you saying something about properties. Maybe you could use those to make my arrows easier to work with?"

## Objectives

- Modify your `Arrow` class to use properties instead of `GetX` and `SetX` methods.
- Ensure the whole program can still run, and Vin can keep creating arrows with it.
