# Level 24: The Catacombs of the class

This level is made entirely of problems wot work through to gain more practice creating classes and doing object-oriented design and culminates in building the game of Tic-Tac-Toe from scratch.

This level contains nine different challenges to test your skill.

The first five challenges involve designing and programming a single class (possibly with some supporting enumerations and always with a main method that uses it).

The next three are object-oriented design challenges. *You do not need to create a working program on these*. Indeed, we haven't quite learned anough to do justice to some aspects of these challenges. You only need to make an object-oriented design that you think could work in the form of CRC cards or some alternative that you feel comfortable with.
