# The Card

The digital Realms of C# have playing cards like ours, but with some differences.

Each card has a colour (`red`, `green`, `blue`, `yellow`) and a rank (the number `1` through `10`, followed by the symbols `$`, `%`, `^`, and `&`).

The third pedestal requires that you create a class to represent a card of this nature.

## Objectives

- Define enumerations for card `colours` and card `ranks`.
- Define a `Card` class to represent a card with a `colour` and a `rank`, as described above.
- Add properties or methods that tell you if a card is a number of symbol card (the equivalent of a face card).
- Create a main method that will create a card instance for the whole deck (every colour with every rank) and display each (for example, "The Red Ampersand", and "The Blue Seven").
- **Answer this question**: Why do you think we used a colour enumeration here but make a Colour class in the previous challenge?
