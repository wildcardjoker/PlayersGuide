# The Five Prototypes

## Entering the Catacombs

You arrive at the Catacombs of the Class, the place that will reveal the path to the Fountain of Objects. The Catacombs lie inside a mountain, with a wide stone entrance leading you into a series of three chambers. In the first chamber, you fine five pedestals with the remnants of a class definition and specific instructions by each. Etched above a sealed doorway at the back of the room it the text, "Only the True Programmer who can remake the Five Prototypes can proceed." Each pedestal appears to have instructions for crafting a class. These are the Five Prototypes that you must reassemble.
