# The Point

The first pedestal asks you to create a `Point` class to store a point in two dimensions.

Each point is represented by an x-coordinate (`x`), a side-to-side distance from a special central point called the origin, and a y-coordinate (`y`), an up-and-down distance away from the origin.

## Objectives

- Define a new `Point` class with properties for `x` and `y`.
- Add a constructor to create a point from a specific `x` and `y` coordinate.
- Add a prarameterless constructor to create a point at the origin `(0,0)`.
- In your main method, create a point at `(2,3)` and another at `(-4,0)`. Display these points on the console window in the format `(x,y)` to illustrate that the class works.
- **Answer this question**: Are your `x` and `y` properties immutable? Why did you choose what you did?
