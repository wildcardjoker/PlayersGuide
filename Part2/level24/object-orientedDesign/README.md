# Object-Oriented Design

## The Chamber of Design

As you finish the final class and place its complete definition back on its pedestal, the writing on each pedestal begins to glow a reddish-orange. A beam forms from each pedestal, extending upward towards the high cavernous ceiling. Additional runes on the wall begin to shine as well, and the far walls slide apart, revealing an opening further into the Catacombs.

You pass through to the next chamber and find three more pedestals with etched text. On the floor, in a ring running around the three pedestals, lie the words, "Only a True Programmer can design a system of objects for the ancient games of the people."

You must make an object-oriented design (not a complete program) for each game described on the three pedestals in the room's center to continue further.

The following three challenges will help you practice object-oriented design. **You do not need to make the full game!** You only need a starting point in the form of CRC cards (or a suitable alternative). Some parts of these games might be tough to write code for, given our current knowledge. For example, the Hangman game would be easier to read a list of words from a file, a topic covered in Level 39.
