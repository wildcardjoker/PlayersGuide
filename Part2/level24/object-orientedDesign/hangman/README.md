# Hangman

The third pedestal in this room requires you to provide an object-oriented design for the game of Hangman. In Hangman, the computer picks a random word for the player to guess. The player then proceeds to guess the word by selecting letters from the alphabet, which get filled in, progressively revealing the word. The player can only get so many letters wrond (a letter not found in teh word) before losing the game. An example run of this game could look like this:

    Word: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ | Remaining: 5 | Incorrect:  | Guess: e
    Word: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ E | Remaining: 5 | Incorrect:  | Guess: i
    Word: I _ _ _ _ _ _ _ E | Remaining: 5 | Incorrect:  | Guess: u
    Word: I _ _ U _ _ _ _ E | Remaining: 5 | Incorrect:  | Guess: o
    Word: I _ _ U _ _ _ _ E | Remaining: 4 | Incorrect: O | Guess: a
    Word: I _ _ U _ A _ _ E | Remaining: 4 | Incorrect: O | Guess: t
    Word: I _ _ U T A _ _ E | Remaining: 4 | Incorrect: O | Guess: s
    Word: I _ _ U T A _ _ E | Remaining: 3 | Incorrect: OS | Guess: r
    Word: I _ _ U T A _ _ E | Remaining: 2 | Incorrect: OSR | Guess: m
    Word: I M M U T A _ _ E | Remaining: 2 | Incorrect: OSR | Guess: l
    Word: I M M U T A _ L E | Remaining: 2 | Incorrect: OSR | Guess: b
    Word: I M M U T A B L E 
    You won!

- The game picks a word at random from a list of words.
- The game's state is displayed to the player, as shown above.
- The player can pick a letter. If they pick a letter they already chose, pick again.
- The game should update its state based on teh letter the player picked.
- The game needs to detect a win for the player (all letters have been guessed).
- The game needs to detect a loss for the player (out of incorrect guesses).

## Objectives

- Use CRC cards (or a suitable alternative) to outline the objects and classes that may be needed to make the game of Hangman. **You do not need to create this full game; just come up with a potential design as a starting point.**
