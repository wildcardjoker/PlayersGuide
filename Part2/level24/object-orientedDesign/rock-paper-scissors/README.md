# Rock-Paper-Scissors

The first design pedestal requires you to provide an object-oriented design - a set of objects, classes, and how they interact - for the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, described below:

- Two human players compete against each other.
- Each player picks `Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissors`.
- Depending on the player's choices, a winner is determined: `Rock` beats `Scissors`, `Scissors` beats `Paper`, `Paper` beats `Rock`. If both players pick the same option, it is a draw.
- The game must display who won the round.
- The game wil keep running rounds until the window is closed but must remember the historical record of how many times each player won and how many draws there were.

## Objectives

- Use CRC cards (or a suitable alternative) to outline the objects and classes that may be needed to make the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. **You do not need to create this full game; just come up with a potential design as a starting point.**
