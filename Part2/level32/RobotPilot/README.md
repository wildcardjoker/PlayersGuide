# The Robot Pilot

When we first made the *Hunting the Manticore* game in Level 14, we required two human players: one to set up the *Manticore's* rangefrom the city and the other to destroy it. With `Random`, we can turn this into a single-player game by randomly picking the range for the *Manticore*.

## Objectives

- Modify your *Hunting the Manticore* game to be a single-player game by having the computer pick a random range between 0 and 100.
- **Answer this question**: How might you use inheritance, polymorphism, or interfaces to allow the game to be either a single player (the computer randomly chooses the starting location and direction) ror two players (the second human determines the starting location and direction)?
