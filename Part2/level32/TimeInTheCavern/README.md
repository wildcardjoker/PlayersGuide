# Time in the Cavern

With `DateTime` and `TimeSpan`, you can track how much time a player spends in the Cavern of Objects to beat the game. With these tools, modify your Fountain of Objects game to display how much time a player spent exploring the caverns.

## Objectives

- When a new game begins, capture thecurrent time using `DateTime`.
- When a game finishes (win or loss), caputrer the current time.
- Use `TimeSpan` to compute how much time elapsed and display that to the player.
