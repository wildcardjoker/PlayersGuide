# The Final Battle

The final battle has arrived. On a volcanic island, enshrouded in a cloud of ash, you have reached the lair of the *Uncoded One*. You have prepared for this fight, and you will return Programming to the lands. Your allies have gathered to engage the Uncoded One's minions on the volcano's slopes while you (and maybe a companion or two) strike into the heart of the Uncoded One's lair to battle and destroy it. Only a True Programmer will be able to survive the encounter, defeat the Uncoded One, and escape!
