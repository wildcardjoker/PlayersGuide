# The Replicator of D'To

While searching an abandoned storage building containing strange code artifacts, you uncover the ancient `Replicator of D'To`. This can replicate the contents of any `int array` into another `array`. But it appears broken and needs a Programmer to reforge the magic that allows it to replicate once again.

## Objectives

- Make a program that creates an `array` of length 5.
- Ask the user for five numbers and put them in the `array`.
- Make a second `array` of length 5.
- Use a loop to copy the values out of the original `array` and into the new one.
- Display the contents of both `arrays` one at a time to illustrate that the `Replicator of D'To` works again.
