# Taking a Number

Many previous tasks have required getting a number from a user. To save time writing this code repeatedly, you have decided to make a method to do this common task.

## Objectives

- Make a method with the signature `int AskForNumber(string text)`. Display the text parameter in the console window, get a response from the user, convert it to an int, and return it. This might look like this: `int results = AskForNumber("What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?");`
- Make a method with the signature `int AskForNumberInRange(string text, int min, int max)`. Only return if the entered number is between the `min` and `max` values. Otherwise, ask again.
- Place these methods in at least one of your previous programs to improve it.
