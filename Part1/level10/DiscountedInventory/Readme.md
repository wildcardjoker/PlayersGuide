# Discounted Inventory

After sorting through Tortuga's outfitter shop and making it viable again, Tortuga realises you've put him back in business. He wants to repay the favour by giving you a 50% discount on anything you buy from him, and he wants you to modify your program to reflect that.

After asking the user for a number, the program should also ask for their name. If the name supplied is your name, cut the price in half before reporting it to the user.

## Objectives

- Modify the `BuyingInventory` program to also ask the user for their name.
- If their name equals your name, divide the cost in half.
