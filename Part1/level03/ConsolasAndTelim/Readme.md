# Consolas and Telim

In the nearby city of Consolas, food is running short. Telim has a magic oven that can produce bread from thin air. He is willing to share, but Telim is an Excelian, and Excelians love paperwork; they demand it for all transactions - no exceptions.Telim will share his bread with the city if you can build a program that lets him enter the names of those receiving it. A sample run of this program looks like this:

    Bread is ready
    Who is the bread for?
    [user enters name]
    Noted: [name] got bread.

## Objectives

- Make a program that runs as shown above, including taking a name from the user.
