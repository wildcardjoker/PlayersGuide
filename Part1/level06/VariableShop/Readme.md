# The Variable Shop

You see an old shopkeeper struggling to stack up variables in a window display.

"Hoo-wee! All these variable types sure are exciting but setting the all up to show them off to excited new programmers like yourself is a lot of work for these aching bones," she says. "You wouldn't mind helping me set up this program with one variable of every type, would you?"

## Objectives
- Build a program with a variable of all fourteen types described in this level.
- Assign each of them a value using a literal of the correct type.
- Use `Console.WriteLine` to display the contents of each variable.

# The Variable Shop Returns

"Hey! Programmer!" It's the shopkeeper from the Variable Shop who hobbles over to you.

"Thanks to your help, variables are selling like RAM cakes! But these people just aren't any good at programming. They keep asking how to modify the values of the variables they're buying, and ... well ... frankly, I have no clue. But you're a programmer, right? Maybe you could show me so I can show my customers?"

## Objectives:
- Modify your Variable Shop program to assign a new, different literal value to each of the 14 original variables.
- Do not declare any additional variables.
- Use `Console.WriteLine` to display the updated contents of each variable.
