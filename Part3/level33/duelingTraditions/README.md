# Dueling Traditions

The inhabitants of Prgrammain, guardians of the Medallion of Organisation, seem to be hiding from you, peering at you through shuttered windows, leaving you alone on the dusty streets. The only other people on the road stand in front of you - a grey-haired wrinkle-faced woman and two toughs who stand just behind her.

"We heard a Programmer might be headed our way. But you're no True Programmer. In the Age Before, programmers declared their `Main` methods, used namespaces, and split their programs into multiple files. You probably don't even know what those things are. Bah!"

She spits on the ground and demands you leave, but you know you know how to use the tools she named. Do the following with one of the larger programs you have created in another challenge.

## Objectives

- Give your program a traditional `Program` and `Main` method instead of top-level statements.
- Place every type in a namespace.
- Place each type in its own file. (Small types like enumerations or records can be an exception).
- **Answer this question**: Having used both top-level statements and a traditional entry point, which do you prefer and why?
    - Both have advantages and disadvantages, hower I prefer Top-level statements as they are more concise, which allows me to concentrate on the code.
