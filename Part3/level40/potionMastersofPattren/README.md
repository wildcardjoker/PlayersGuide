# The Potion Masters of Pattren

The island of Pattren is home to skilled potion masters in need of some help. Potions are mixed by adding one ingredient at a time until they produce a valuable potion type. The potion masters will give you the Patterned Medallion if you help them make a program to build potions according to the rules below:

- All potions start as water.
- Adding stardust to water turns it into an elixir.
- Adding snake venom to an elixir turns it into a poison potion.
- Adding dragon breath to an elixir turns it into a flying potion.
- Adding shadow glass to an elixir turns it into an invisibility potion.
- Adding an eyeshine gem to an elixir turns it into a night sight potion.
- Adding shadow glass to a night sight potion turns it into a cloudy brew.
- Adding an eyeshine gem to an invisibility potion turns it into a cloudy brew.
- Adding stardust to a cloudy brew turns it into a wraith potion.
- Anything else results in a ruined potion.

## Objective

- Create enumerations for the potion and ingredient types.
- Tell the user what type of potion they currently have and what ingredient choices are available.
- Allow them to enter an ingredient choice. Use a pattern to turn the user's response into an ingredient.
- Change the current potion type according to the rules above using a pattern.
- Allow them to choose whether to complete the potion or continue before adding an ingredient. If the user decides to complete the potion, end the program.
- When the user creates a ruined potion, tell them and start over with water.
