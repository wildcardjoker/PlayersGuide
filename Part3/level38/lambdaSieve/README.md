# The Lambda Sieve

The city of Lambdan, also on the Island of Delgata, believes that the great Numeromechanical Sieve, which you worked on in Level 36, could be made better by using lambda expressions instead of regular, named methods. If you can help them convince island leadership to make this change, they will give you the Lambda Medallion and pledge the Lambdani Fleet's assistance in the coming final battle.

## Objectives

- Modify your _The Sieve_ program from Level 36 to use lambda expressions for the constructor instead of named methods for each of the three filters.
- **Answer this question**: Does this change make the program shorter or longer?
- **Answer this question**: Does this change make the program easier to read or harder?
