# Repairing the Clocktower

The recent attacks damaged the great Clocktower of Consolas. The citizens of Consolas have repaired most of it, except one piece that requires the steady hand of a Programmer. It is the part that makes the clock `tick` and `tock`. Numbers flow into the clock to make it go, and if the number is even, the clock's pendulum should `tick` to to the left; if the number is odd, the pendulum should `tock` to the right. Only a programmer can recreate this critical clock element to make it work again.

## Objectives

- Take a number as input from the console
- Display the word "`tick`" if the number is even. Display the word "`tock`" if the number is odd.
- **Hint**: Remember that you can use the remainder operator to determine if a number is even or odd.
