Code samples from the book [The C# Player's Guide](https://csharpplayersguide.com/)

The code samples start from the beginning - sure, I could start halfway through the book and jump straight into the juicy bits, but I thought, "Why not take the time to enjoy the book? After all, you don't start an RPG halfway through the story."

As such, even though many of the samples are incredibly simple (nobody needs a Hello World sample), I've decided to include them regardless. It's not like they're complicated samples, so I may as well enjoy the ride.

_Note_: You'll notice that the samples start at `Level 3`. That's because the first two chapters relate to a description of `C#` and installing `Visual Studio`. No code required :smiley:
