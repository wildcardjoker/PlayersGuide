# PlayersGuide
Code samples from the book [The C# Player's Guide](https://csharpplayersguide.com/)

The code samples start from the beginning - sure, I could start halfway through the book and jump straight into the juicy bits, but I thought, "Why not take the time to enjoy the book? After all, you don't start an RPG halfway through the story."

As such, even though many of the samples are incredibly simple (nobody needs a Hello World sample), I've decided to include them regardless. It's not like they're complicated samples, so I may as well enjoy the ride.

## Missing Levels

You'll notice that some levels don't have a matching code sample. The :blue_book: doesn't have code samples for every ~chapter~ Level :smiley:. Here's a list of the "missing" chapters, and why there's no corresponding sample:

- :bookmark: Level  1: A description and introduction to `C#`.
- :bookmark: Level  2: A guide to installing Visual Studio.
- :bookmark: Level  5: An introduction to variables.
- :bookmark: Level 15: Object-oriented Concepts.
- :bookmark: Level 22: Null handling.
- :bookmark: Level 23: A primer on object-oriented design concepts.
- :bookmark: Level 46: A primer on unsafe code; the book references https://www.pinvoke.net, however you may be better off using [CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32) instead.
- :bookmark: Level 47: A Primer on other language features
  - Iterators and the `yield` keyword
  - `Async` enumerables
  - Constants
  - Attributes
  - Reflection
  - The `nameof` operator
  - Nested Types
  - Accessibility modifiers
  - Bit manipulation
  - `using` statements and the `IDisposable` interface
  - Preprocessor directives
  - Command-line arguments
  - Partial classes
  - Generic covariance and contravariance
  - `checked` and `unchecked` contexts
  - Volatile fields
- :bookmark: Level 49: An advanced Primer on compilers, and the C# virtual machine/instruction set in particular
