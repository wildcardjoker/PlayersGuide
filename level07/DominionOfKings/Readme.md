# The Dominion of Kings

Three kings, Melik, Casik, and Balik, are sitting around a table, debating who has the greatest kingdom among them. Each king rules and assortment of `provinces`, `duchies`, and `estates`.

Collectively, they agree to a point system that helps them judge whose kingdom is greatest: Every `estate` is worth 1 point, every `duchy` is worth 3 points, and every `province` is worth 6 points. They just need a program that will allow them to enter their current holdings and compute a point total.

## Objectives

- Create a program that allows users to enter how many `provinces`, `duchies`, and `estates` they have.
- Add up the user's total score, giving `1` point per `estate`, `3` per `duchy`, and `6` per `province`.
- Display the point total to the user.
